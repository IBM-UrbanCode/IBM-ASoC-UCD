This plugin contains only one step at the moment.
This step allows you to run a security scan on your Android application using IBM Security Testing services on Smartcloud Exchange.

To setup the scan step load the plugin to UrbanCode and drag the "Start Mobile Analyzer Scan" to the designer.
The step has the following properties:
1. Name: The name for your step in UrbanCode deploy (e.g. "My test app security scan"). 
2. APK file location: Location of the APK file you want to scan (e.g. "c:\build_output\testapp.apk").
3. IBM ID Username: Your IBM Id login username (e.g. "myibmid@gmail.com").
4. IBM ID Password: Your IBM Id login password.
5. Fail condition threshold (H, M, L, I): Fail condition for the result of the scan in High, Medium, Low, Information issue count format. 
   For example 0,5,10,20 will cause the step to fail if the resulting scan has more than 0 High issues, 5 Medium issue etc.
   Leave empty for no validation of results.
6. Scan Timeout (minutes): The time in minutes to wait for the scan to end before failing.
7. Original scan ID: In case you want to perform a rescan add the original scan id here.
8. Working Directory: The report of the scan will be saved to this directory.
