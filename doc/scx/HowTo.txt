This plugin currently contains four steps only: one for scanning web applications, one for scanning Android applications, one for scanning iOS applications and one for scanning Java/Java web content.

"Start Android Mobile Analyzer ASoC Scan" Step:
This step lets you run a security scan on your Android application using IBM Application Security on Cloud.

To setup the scan step:
1. Load the plugin to UrbanCode
2. Drag the "Start Android Mobile Analyzer ASoC Scan" to the designer.
3. Supply the following properties (as needed):
	- Name: The name for your scan in UrbanCode deploy (e.g. "My test app security scan"). 
	- APK file location: Location of the APK file you want to scan (e.g. "c:\build_output\testapp.apk").
	- IBM ID Username: Your IBM ID login username (e.g. "myibmid@gmail.com").
	- IBM ID Password: Your IBM ID login password.
	- Fail condition threshold (H, M, L, I): Fail condition for the result of the scan in High, Medium, Low, Informational issue count format. 
		For example 0,5,10,20 will cause the step to fail if the scan finds more than 0 High issues, 5 Medium issue etc.
		Leave empty for no validation of results.
	- Scan Timeout (minutes): The time in minutes to wait for the scan to end before failing.
	- Original scan ID: To perform a rescan, add the original scan ID here.
	- Working Directory: The directory you want the scan report saved to.
	
"Start iOS Analyzer ASoC Scan" Step:
This step lets you run a security scan on your iOS application using IBM Application Security on Cloud.

To setup the scan step:
1. Load the plugin to UrbanCode
2. Drag the "Start iOS Analyzer ASoC Scan" to the designer.
3. Supply the following properties (as needed):
	- Name: The name for your scan in UrbanCode deploy (e.g. "My test app security scan"). 
	- Xcode project or workspace location: Location of the xcode project or workspace you want to scan (e.g. "/Users/admin/Downloads/iOSTestApp/testapp.xcodeproj" for a project, or "/Users/admin/Downloads/iOSTestApp/testapp.xcworkspace" for a workspace).
	- Workspace Scheme: When using a workspace, you must specify a scheme (defined inside your workspace, can be obtained by running "xcodebuild -workspace <workspace path> -list" on your MAC)
	- IBM ID Username: Your IBM ID login username (e.g. "myibmid@gmail.com").
	- IBM ID Password: Your IBM ID login password.
	- Fail condition threshold (H, M, L, I): Fail condition for the result of the scan in High, Medium, Low, Informational issue count format. 
		For example 0,5,10,20 will cause the step to fail if the scan finds more than 0 High issues, 5 Medium issue etc.
		Leave empty for no validation of results.
	- Scan Timeout (minutes): The time in minutes to wait for the scan to end before failing.
	- Original scan ID: To perform a rescan, add the original scan ID here.
	- Working Directory: The directory you want the scan report saved to.

"Start Dynamic Analyzer ASoC Scan" Step:
This step lets you run a security scan on your Web application using IBM Application Security on Cloud.

To setup the scan step:
1. Load the plugin to UrbanCode
2. Drag the "Start Dynamic Analyzer ASoC Scan" to the designer.
3. Supply the following properties (as needed):
	- Name: The name for your step in UrbanCode deploy (e.g. "My test web app security scan"). 
	- Starting URL: The URL of your application. (You must complete Domain Verification through the UI, as it is not currently supported by this plugin.)
	- Application Username: If your application requires login credentials, enter the username here (e.g. "adminUser"), otherwise leave blank.
	- Application Password: If your application requires login credentials, enter the password here (e.g. "adminPassword"), otherwise leave blank.
	- IBM ID Username: Your IBM ID login username (e.g. "myibmid@gmail.com").
	- IBM ID Password: Your IBM ID login password.
	- Fail condition threshold (H, M, L, I): Fail condition for the result of the scan in High, Medium, Low, Informational issue count format. 
		For example 0,5,10,20 will cause the step to fail if the scan finds more than 0 High issues, 5 Medium issue etc.
		Leave empty for no validation of results.
	- Scan Timeout (minutes): The time in minutes to wait for the scan to end before failing.
	- Original scan ID: To perform a rescan, add the original scan ID here.
	- Working Directory: The directory you want the scan report saved to.
	
"Start Static Analyzer ASoC Scan" Step:
This step allows you to run a security scan of Java or Java web content using IBM Application Security on Cloud.

To setup the scan step:
1. Load the plugin to UrbanCode
2. Drag the "Start Static Analyzer ASoC Scan" to the designer.
3. Supply the following properties (as needed):
	- Name: A name to identify the step in UrbanCode Deploy. For example, “My static analyzer scan”. 
	- IRX file/Scan directory: The IRX file to be uploaded for scanning, or the directory that contains the files or other locations to scan. 
	The files and locations that can be specified in this field include: .jar files, .war files, .ear files, Eclipse workspaces, and scan configuration files. 
	For example, “c:\build_output\testapp.irx” or “c:\build_output”.
	- Static Analyzer Client Tool location: The directory that the client tool was unzipped to. For example, C:\SAClientUtil.
	- IBM ID Username: Your IBM ID login username (e.g. "myibmid@gmail.com").
	- IBM ID Password: Your IBM ID login password.
	- Fail condition threshold (H, M, L, I): Set the number of issues found (by severity) in a comma-separated list.
	If the threshold is reached during the scan, the scan will fail. 
		For example, a fail condition of (0,5,10,20) will cause the step to fail if the resulting scan has more than 0 High issues, 5 Medium issues, and so on. 
		If this field is left empty, there will be no validation of results and the scan will not have a fail condition.
	- Scan Timeout (minutes): The time in minutes to wait for the scan to end before it fails.
	- Original scan ID: If you have previously scanned the application, enter the original scan ID here if you want to rescan it.
	- Working Directory: The path to which the scan report will be saved.
