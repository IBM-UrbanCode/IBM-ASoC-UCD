This plugin currently contains three steps only: one for scanning web applications, one for scanning Android applications and one for scanning Java/Java web content.

"Start Mobile Analyzer Scan" Step:
This step lets you run a security scan on your Android application using IBM Security Testing services on Bluemix.

To setup the scan step:
1. Load the plugin to UrbanCode
2. Drag the "Start Mobile Analyzer Scan" to the designer.
3. Supply the following properties (as needed):
	- Name: The name for your scan in UrbanCode deploy (e.g. "My test app security scan"). 
	- APK file location: Location of the APK file you want to scan (e.g. "c:\build_output\testapp.apk").
	- Bluemix Binding ID: After creating an application in Bluemix and binding it to our service, you'll receive application credentials.
	This is the "userid" field in these credentials.
	- Bluemix Binding Password: After creating an application in Bluemix and binding it to our service, you'll receive application credentials.
	This is the "password" field in these credentials.
	- Fail condition threshold (H, M, L, I): Fail condition for the result of the scan in High, Medium, Low, Informational issue count format. 
		For example 0,5,10,20 will cause the step to fail if the scan finds more than 0 High issues, 5 Medium issue etc.
		Leave empty for no validation of results.
	- Scan Timeout (minutes): The time in minutes to wait for the scan to end before failing.
	- Original scan ID: To perform a rescan, add the original scan ID here.
	- Working Directory: The directory you want the scan report saved to.


"Start Dynamic Analyzer Scan" Step:
This step lets you run a security scan on your Web application using IBM Security Testing services on Bluemix

To setup the scan step:
1. Load the plugin to UrbanCode
2. Drag the "Start Dynamic Analyzer Scan" to the designer.
3. Supply the following properties (as needed):
	- Name: The name for your step in UrbanCode deploy (e.g. "My test web app security scan"). 
	- Starting URL: The URL of your Bluemix application (e.g. "http://mytestapp.mybluemix.net/").
	- Application Username: If your application requires login credentials, enter the username here (e.g. "adminUser"), otherwise leave blank.
	- Application Password: If your application requires login credentials, enter the password here (e.g. "adminPassword"), otherwise leave blank.
	- Bluemix Binding ID: After creating an application in Bluemix and binding it to our service, you'll receive the application credentials.
	This is the "userid" field in these credentials.
	- Bluemix Binding Password: After creating an application in Bluemix and binding it to our service, you'll receive the application credentials.
	This is the "password" field in these credentials.
	- Fail condition threshold (H, M, L, I): Fail condition for the result of the scan in High, Medium, Low, Informational issue count format. 
		For example 0,5,10,20 will cause the step to fail if the scan finds more than 0 High issues, 5 Medium issue etc.
		Leave empty for no validation of results.
	- Scan Timeout (minutes): The time in minutes to wait for the scan to end before failing.
	- Original scan ID: To perform a rescan, add the original scan ID here.
	- Working Directory: The directory you want the scan report saved to.
	
"Start Static Analyzer Scan" Step:
This step allows you to run a security scan of Java or Java web content using the IBM Static Analyzer for Bluemix service.

To setup the scan step:
1. Load the plugin to UrbanCode
2. Drag the "Start Static Analyzer Scan" to the designer.
3. Supply the following properties (as needed):
	- Name: A name to identify the step in UrbanCode Deploy. For example, “My static analyzer scan”. 
	- IRX file/Scan directory: The IRX file to be uploaded for scanning, or the directory that contains the files or other locations to scan. 
	The files and locations that can be specified in this field include: .jar files, .war files, .ear files, Eclipse workspaces, and scan configuration files. 
	For example, “c:\build_output\testapp.irx” or “c:\build_output”.
	- Static Analyzer Client Tool location: The directory that the client tool was unzipped to. For example, C:\SAClientUtil.
	- Bluemix Binding ID: After creating an app in Bluemix and binding it to the Static Analyzer service, open the app overview and click “Show Credentials” in the Static Analyzer service. From those credentials, note the “bindingid” and enter it in this field.
	- Bluemix Binding Password: In the Static Analyzer credentials (see the above property), note the “password” and enter it in this field.
	- Fail condition threshold (H, M, L, I): Set the number of issues found (by severity) in a comma-separated list.
	If the threshold is reached during the scan, the scan will fail. 
		For example, a fail condition of (0,5,10,20) will cause the step to fail if the resulting scan has more than 0 High issues, 5 Medium issues, and so on. 
		If this field is left empty, there will be no validation of results and the scan will not have a fail condition.
	- Scan Timeout (minutes): The time in minutes to wait for the scan to end before it fails.
	- Original scan ID: If you have previously scanned the application, enter the original scan ID here if you want to rescan it.
	- Working Directory: The path to which the scan report will be saved.
